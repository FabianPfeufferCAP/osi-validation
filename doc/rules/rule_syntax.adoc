= Rule syntax

Each rule starts with a hyphen followed by a space character.
Rules can have parameters.
If a rule has parameters, it is written as a _mapping_, a scalar followed by a colon.
The exact nature of the parameters depends on the rule.
For example, the rule `is_greater_than_or_equal_to` accepts a double, while `check_if` accepts a list of dictionaries with mappings.

The following code shows some examples of valid rules.
