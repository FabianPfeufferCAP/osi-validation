= File structure

Rules are contained in *.yml-files in the directory `requirements-osi-3/`.
The organization of the files in this folder follows the architecture of OSI for consistency.

Each root at the top level represents a root message type.
The children of each root message represent fields or submessages.
Fields use lowercase, submessages use CamelCase.
Each field has a sequence of rules that apply to that specific field. 
Each rule starts with a hyphen followed by a space character.

**Example**

Below you can see an example of the `osi_detectedlane.yml` rule file.
The rules affect the definitions in `osi_detectedlane.proto`:
`DetectedLane` has a field called `header`.
`CandidateLane` is a submessage of `DetectedLane`.
The rules state that `probability` of `CandidateLane` is always between 0 and 1.
